### Description
***
The primary objective of this project is the development of a system designed for the recognition of specific trigger words. The implementation leverages an Arduino Nano 33 BLE, incorporating TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and the Tiny Conv model. The focal point of this endeavour is wanted word recognition, a process that entails the system's proficiency in detecting and categorizing particular keywords or phrases from spoken input. In this instance, the targeted wanted words are "all," "none," "never," and "must." The methodology involves harnessing the processing capabilities of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, synergizing them with the versatility of TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite. The adoption of the Tiny Conv model architecture is pivotal to ensuring optimal performance and judicious resource utilization on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE platform.
